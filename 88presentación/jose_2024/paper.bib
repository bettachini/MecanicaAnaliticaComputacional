	abstract = {An inverted, or ﬂipped, classroom, where content delivery includes video lectures watched outside of the classroom, is a method that can free classroom time for learner-centered activities such as active and problem-based learning. This study compared the effectiveness of an inverted classroom to a traditional classroom in three areas: 1) content coverage; 2) student performance on traditional quizzes and exam problems; and 3) student observations and perception of the inverted classroom format. A controltreatment experiment comparing an inverted classroom to a traditional lecture-style format was used. The results show that: 1) the inverted classroom allowed the instructor to cover more material; 2) students participating in the inverted classroom performed as well or better on comparable quiz and exam questions and on openended design problems; and 3) while students initially struggled with the new format, they adapted quickly and found the inverted classroom format to be satisfactory and effective.},

	abstract = {Introduction: International organizations have drawn attention to the idea of adapting learning to fit the graduates’ skills and competences to the current requirements of labor market. Therefore, reaching a deep learning of academic contents along with developing creative ability for problem solving emerges as a desirable goal to be reached.
Objective: The study was aimed at analyzing the Deep and Surface learning approaches as well as creativity–comprising the creative process and the creative personality– by socio-demographic and academic variables in college students.
Method: A non-experimental and cross-sectional design was conducted, entailing two studies: a groupdifferences one and another, explanatory. The sample was composed of 301 college students attendingtwo majors –Psychology (51\%) and Engineering (49\%).
Results: Significant differences in the use of learning approaches were found; women used the Deep approach more often whereas men chose the Surface approach. As for creativity, men showed statistically significant differences in creative personality over women. The creative process arose more often in Psychology students when compared with Engineering undergraduates, with significant p-values. Academic achievement was negatively explained by the Surface approach (β=-.276) and positively, by the creative process (β=.185).
Conclusions: Boosting academic achievement requires a major adjustment in teaching and evaluation methods. They should be aimed at discouraging the use of the Surface approach whilst promoting the occurrence of creative processes in students. Moreover, such changes in educational practices should be focused on improving deep learning and creativity in order to make the graduates’ skills more suitable for current labor market requirements},

	abstract = {Flipped Classroom is a model that’s quickly gaining recognition as a novel teaching approach among health science curricula. The purpose of this study was four-fold and aimed to compare Flipped Classroom effectiveness ratings with: 1) student socio-demographic characteristics, 2) student final grades, 3) student overall course satisfaction, and 4) course pre-Flipped Classroom effectiveness ratings. The participants in the study consisted of 67 Masters-level graduate students in an introductory epidemiology class. Data was collected from students who completed surveys during three time points (beginning, middle and end) in each term. The Flipped Classroom was employed for the academic year 2012–2013 (two terms) using both pre-class activities and in-class activities. Among the 67 Masters-level graduate students, 80\% found the Flipped Classroom model to be either somewhat effective or very effective (M = 4.1/5.0). International students rated the Flipped Classroom to be significantly more effective when compared to North American students (X2 = 11.35, p {\textless} 0.05). Students’ perceived effectiveness of the Flipped Classroom had no significant association to their academic performance in the course as measured by their final grades (rs = 0.70). However, students who found the Flipped Classroom to be effective were also more likely to be satisfied with their course experience. Additionally, it was found that the {SEEQ} variable scores for students enrolled in the Flipped Classroom were significantly higher than the ones for students enrolled prior to the implementation of the Flipped Classroom (p = 0.003). Overall, the format of the Flipped Classroom provided more opportunities for students to engage in critical thinking, independently facilitate their own learning, and more effectively interact with and learn from their peers. Additionally, the instructor was given more flexibility to cover a wider range and depth of material, provide in-class applied learning opportunities based on problem-solving activities and offer timely feedback/guidance to students. Yet in our study, this teaching style had its fair share of challenges, which were largely dependent on the use and management of technology. Despite these challenges, the Flipped Classroom proved to be a novel and effective teaching approach at the graduate level setting.},

Google Colab notebooks can introduce students to programming concepts and could be a convenient tool to assist in the chemistry teaching process. In this article, we implemented Google Colab notebooks to aid in the teaching of thermodynamics in a physical chemistry class. We presented six notebooks, covering introductory concepts of both coding and thermodynamics as a set of learning objects that can be useful in a virtual learning environment. In addition, in some of the notebooks, we included a step-by-step guide on how to run virtual lab simulations. The Colab notebooks were created for students without previous experience in programming. All of the Colab notebooks contain exercises of the activities and the solutions of the proposed exercises. Furthermore, all of the Colab notebooks can be modified and downloaded from the Github repository. Finally, we used the Python programming language and Colab because they are free and widely used by the academic community.},
