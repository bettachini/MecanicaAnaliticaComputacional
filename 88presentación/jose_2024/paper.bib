	abstract = {An inverted, or ﬂipped, classroom, where content delivery includes video lectures watched outside of the classroom, is a method that can free classroom time for learner-centered activities such as active and problem-based learning. This study compared the effectiveness of an inverted classroom to a traditional classroom in three areas: 1) content coverage; 2) student performance on traditional quizzes and exam problems; and 3) student observations and perception of the inverted classroom format. A controltreatment experiment comparing an inverted classroom to a traditional lecture-style format was used. The results show that: 1) the inverted classroom allowed the instructor to cover more material; 2) students participating in the inverted classroom performed as well or better on comparable quiz and exam questions and on openended design problems; and 3) while students initially struggled with the new format, they adapted quickly and found the inverted classroom format to be satisfactory and effective.},

	abstract = {Various studies have reported the versatility and great scope of programming tools in all areas of knowledge. Coding is generally of paramount importance to chemistry students regardless of whether they intend to work with theoretical chemistry. Google Colab notebooks can introduce students to programming concepts and could be a convenient tool to assist in the chemistry teaching process. In this article, we implemented Google Colab notebooks to aid in the teaching of thermodynamics in a physical chemistry class. We presented six notebooks, covering introductory concepts of both coding and thermodynamics as a set of learning objects that can be useful in a virtual learning environment. In addition, in some of the notebooks, we included a step-by-step guide on how to run virtual lab simulations. The Colab notebooks were created for students without previous experience in programming. All of the Colab notebooks contain exercises of the activities and the solutions of the proposed exercises. Furthermore, all of the Colab notebooks can be modiﬁed and downloaded from the Github repository. Finally, we used the Python programming language and Colab because they are free and widely used by the academic community.},
