Greetings from the southern tip of Latinamerica.
We're a group of physicists trying to convey our mechanical engineering students the usefulness of merging coding and physics for their professional carrer.
For that purpose we apply tools and methodologies I want to tell you about.
One of those is AI so I hope you'll have questions about it.

In the 50s the american psychologist Licklider found that most of intellectual work are mundane tasks.
At least in our country classes at university are an excercise on transcription.

Licklider saw at that time the potential of computers to free ourselves of those mundane tasks.
