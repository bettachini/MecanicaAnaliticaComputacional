To provide the practicing engineer with applications or boilerplate code to quickly replicate and solve real-world systems common in mechanical engineering
To give the engineering student a code base from which to supplement learning through hand-calculations and an easy way to check work.
There are many different tools available to engineers. Hand-calculations, spreadsheets, and code are all great ways to perform calculations or visualize data or concepts. {MATLAB} is the defacto tool to solve many engineering calculations, but is just too expensive to be a practical tool for many of us. Octave, Scilab, or Freelab are great alternatives, but is limited in scope to calculation. I began using python for calculations and visualizations and have found it to be a very powerful tool with many existing modules for mathematics and plotting, in addition to the thousands of other libraries for general computing.},

Increasingly, it is not ‘just’ quantitative skills that are needed, but computational ones. However, the majority of undergraduate programmes have yet to offer much more than a one-off ‘{GIS} programming’ class since such courses are seen as challenging not only for students to take, but for staff to deliver. Using evaluation criterion of minimal complexity, maximal flexibility, interactivity, utility, and maintainability, we show how the technical features of Jupyter notebooks—particularly when combined with the popularity of Anaconda Python and Docker—enabled us to develop and deliver a suite of three ‘geocomputation’ modules to Geography undergraduates, with some progressing to data science and analytics roles.},

This includes support for rich syntax such as citations and cross-references, math and equations, and figures. ✔ Write content in Jupyter Notebook. This allows you to include your code and outputs in your book. You can also write notebooks entirely in Markdown that get executed when you build your book. ✔ Execute and cache your book’s content. For {\textless}code{\textgreater}.ipynb{\textless}/code{\textgreater} and Markdown notebooks, execute code and insert the latest outputs into your book. In addition, cache and re-use outputs to be used later. ✔ Insert notebook outputs into your content. Generate outputs as you build your documentation, and insert them in-line with your content across pages. ✔ Add interactivity to your book. You can toggle cell visibility, include interactive outputs from Jupyter, and connect with online services like Binder. ✔ Generate a variety of outputs. This includes single- and multi-page websites, as well as {PDF} outputs. ✔ Build books with a simple command-line interface. You can quickly generate your books with one command, like so: {\textless}code{\textgreater}jupyter-book build mybook/{\textless}/code{\textgreater}},

Lamentablemente tras que la teoría y uso de estas herramientas son aprendidos por los alumnos no suelen 
aprovecharse en profundidad en cursos de años posteriores. 
En este trabajo se describe la experiencia que se tuvo en la asignatura Mecánica general del 3.er año de la carrera en la {UNLaM}. Tradicionalmente los sistemas modelados se limitan a los resolubles analíticamente por trabajar en pizarrón o papel. En este curso, los 
estudiantes resolvieron sus ejercicios utilizando código en lenguaje Python, haciendo uso de herramientas de este siglo, como bibliotecas de funciones para el cálculo simbólico, numérico, graficación, etc. 
Todas las clases se dictaron íntegramente usando cuadernos de Jupyter como plataforma. En estos se intercala código con información gráfica y texto incluyendo una clara notación matemática con simbología {LaTeX}. Este código es re-utilizable por el estudiante para resolver la ejercitación del curso con la misma herramienta, así como para ser aprovechado en asignaturas futuras y en su vida profesional. 
Estos cuadernos se ejecutan sobre software libre. Plataformas web de acceso gratuito a través del navegador permitieron a los estudiantes ejecutarlos en su hogar o trabajo, permitiendo comentar y editar en forma conjunta un mismo cuaderno entre alumnos y/o docentes. 
La pandemia nos forzó a enseñar a través de una computadora. Tras un periodo inicial de adaptación los estudiantes reconocieron las virtudes de esta metodología. Inclusive la evaluación fue más enriquecedora que en un curso convencional al alcanzar la complejidad de simular sistemas mecánicos similares a los industriales.},

	title = {Tips for Creating Slideshows in Jupyter},
	url = {https://www.markroepke.me/posts/2019/06/05/tips-for-slideshows-in-jupyter.html},
	abstract = {In a previous post I wrote about how to create interactive slideshows in Jupyter Notebooks. It covered the benefits, basic technology, basic slide creation, and how to view and operate the slideshow. This post dives a little deeper by providing key tips on creating better-looking slides, customizing formatting, exporting to {HTML}, hosting slides live online, etc. Tip 1: Split slides into two columns A built-in option in slideshow platforms like {PowerPoint} is to split content into two columns. While this isn’t a default capability in Jupyter slideshows, it can be easily added using with the Jupyter extension splitcell. Installing and enabling splitcell splitcell can be installed by running the following on the command line: conda install -c conda-forge jupyter\_contrib\_nbextensions or: pip install jupyter\_contrib\_nbextensions And then it can be enabled by running: jupyter nbextension enable splitcell/splitcell More information on installing/enabling Jupyter extensions is available on {GitHub}. Using splitcell Once installed and enabled, splitcell is easy to use. With an open notebook and a cell selected, press the {SHIFT} + S keys to “split” the cell and align it to a certain column. By default, the first cell will align to the left side, and then the right side will be filled by pressing {SHIFT} + S on subsequent cells. When the notebook is then put into presentation mode, the cells with stay in their columns giving two-column content on slides. The left column will be processed before the right column (but they can appear at the same time by selecint “-“ in the right cell slideshow toolbar). Below is an example of splitcell in action in a slideshow: A major advantage of creating columns using splitcell is that it works for both code and {HTML}/markdown content. Tip 2: Hide code from slideshow I often find that I want to hide the Python code used to generate output from a slideshow. A common example of this is hiding the code used to print a pandas {DataFrame} when only interested in talking about data. If you want to hide all of the code within a cell but still run the cell and print its output to a slideshow, you can use the following Python function: def hide\_code\_in\_slideshow(): from {IPython} import display import binascii import os uid = binascii.hexlify(os.urandom(8)).decode() html = """{\textless}div id="\%s"{\textgreater}{\textless}/div{\textgreater} {\textless}script type="text/javascript"{\textgreater} \$(function()\{ var p = \$("\#\%s"); if (p.length==0) return; while (!p.{hasClass}("cell")) \{ p=p.parent(); if (p.prop("{tagName}") =="body") return; \} var cell = p; cell.find(".input").{addClass}("hide-in-slideshow") \}); {\textless}/script{\textgreater}""" \% (uid, uid) display.display\_html(html, raw=True) All you have to do is import the function or define it within the slideshow notebook, and then call hide\_code\_in\_slideshow() from within any cell whose code you wish to hide. The code will still appear in the Notebook, but will not be present in the slideshow. Below is an example of hide\_code\_in\_slideshow() in action: I find hide\_code\_in\_slideshow() particularly useful when delivering a training session or delivering results to non-technical audiences. Tip 3: Add speaker notes In my opinion, one of the most desirable slideshow features is the ability to include speaker notes. This functionality is built into {RISE} and is really easy to use. In order to add speaker notes to a slide, you should create a new markdown cell directly beneath the final cell that is part of said slide and select ‘Notes’ from the cell toolbar. Next, you can type any of notes you’d like in the cell. In order to activate the notes in a {RISE} slideshow, you can press the T key to toggle the speaker notes window. A new window will pop up that contains the live slideshow, a view of the next slide, and the speaker notes associated with the current slide. Below is an example of {RISE}’s speaker notes functionality: The best part about this separate speaker window is that it’s linked to the original slideshow window - this means you can extend your screen when presenting and have the speaker window on your laptop and the original slideshow window projecting to a larger screen. Tip 4: Turn your slides into a writable chalkboard The next tip is another feature built directly into {RISE}: the ability to write over top of a slide and launch a blank chalkboard. This is particularly useful during training and teaching sessions. {RISE}’s chalkboard feature can be enabled by adding the below data to the Jupyter Notebook’s metadata. You can edit the Jupyter Notebook metadata by clicking on “Edit” in the Jupyter Notebooks toolbar, and then clicking on “Edit Notebook Metadata”. \{ ..., "rise": \{ "enable\_chalkboard": true \} \} Once added to the notebook metadata, the Jupyter Notebook must be shutdown and restarted to launch with the chalkboard feature enabled. When the notebook is relaunched and presentation mode is enabled, you’ll see two new buttons in the bottom-left corner of the slide: As mentioned, the chalkboard feature provides two core funcationalities: writing on top of a current slide and launching a blank chalkboard. The button on the right enables writing on top of the current slide and the button in the middle launches a blank chalkboard. Here’s a demonstration of writing on top of the current slide: The chalkboard simply launches a blank black chalkboard with the ability to write using virtual chalk. Tip 5: Customize slide appearance with custom {CSS} By default, slides appear as white with a basic black text. However, there is often a desire to customize the background, fonts, images, or headers and footers of slides. This can be achieved with {CSS}. Adding default {CSS} A default {CSS} can be added to all notebooks within a directory by creating a {CSS} file titled rise.css within the same directory of the notebooks. All of the notebooks in this directory will then use rise.css by default. An example of a basic rise.css file can be found in the {GitHub} repository for one of my existing trainings. This little amount of {CSS} can make a large difference in the visual aesthetic of your slides: Adding notebook-specific {CSS} If you are wanting to add specific {CSS} files for a specific notebook (let’s call it notebook-name.ipynb), you can simply create a {CSS} file in the directory of the notebook titled notebook-name.css. Tip 6: Host live slides online with Binder One of the drawbacks of {RISE} is that it requires a running Jupyter Notebooks instance. While this isn’t too problematic for live presentations hosted on a local computer, it can be make the result hard to share. The next two tips provide ways to do that. Live {RISE} slides can be shared using a Jupyter-created product called Binder. Binder allows you to host a live Jupyter Notebooks session for free within a browser – therefore, no Python and/or Jupyter setup is required for users. Binder works by accepting a link to your project’s {GitHub} repository. Tip 7: Export slides directly to {HTML} for non-live viewing Slideshows developed in Jupyter Notebooks can also be exported to a single {HTML} file. While this method does not include many of the live features {RISE} offerse through a running Pythons session, it does enable the sharing of slideshows through a single {HTML} file. This can be done using the jupyter nbconvert command on the command line. This is the command I use: jupyter nbconvert notebook-name.ipynb --to-slides --reveal-prefix reveal.js If you do not have reveal.js installed locally, you can use an online version: jupyter nbconvert notebook-name.ipynb --to-slides --reveal-prefix "http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/reveal.js/3.3.0" A single {HTML} file will be created in the same directory as the notebook, and opening this {HTML} will will open the slideshow. Tip 8: Open slides automatically Sometimes it’s useful to share live slideshows rather than static ones. Binder makes this possible by providing an easy notebook-sharing mechanism, but viewers still need to active presentation mode within the notebook. {RISE}’s autolaunch feature solves this problem. {RISE}’s autolaunch feature can be enabled by adding the below data to the Jupyter Notebook’s metadata. You can edit the Jupyter Notebook metadata by clicking on “Edit” in the Jupyter Notebooks toolbar, and then clicking on “Edit Notebook Metadata”. \{ ..., "rise": \{ "autolaunch": true \} \} With this feature enabled, the slideshow will automatically launch when the notebook itself is launched},

The educational design centers on a new type of assignment called a computational essay, which was developed and implemented over the course of two semesters of an intermediate electricity and magnetism course at the University of Oslo, Norway. We describe the motivation, learning goals, and scaffolds used in the computational essay project, with the intention that other educators will be able to replicate and adapt our design. We also report on initial findings from this implementation, including key features of student-written computational essays, student reflections on the inquiry process, and self-reported conceptual and attitudinal development. Based on these findings, we argue that computational essays can serve a key role in introducing students to open-ended, inquiry-based work and setting the foundation for future computational research and studies.},

	url = {https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Flipped_classroom&oldid=1099871410},
	abstract = {A flipped classroom is an instructional strategy and a type of blended learning, which aims to increase student engagement and learning by having pupils complete readings at home and work on live problem-solving during class time. This pedagogical style moves activities, including those that may have traditionally been considered homework, into the classroom. With a flipped classroom, students watch online lectures, collaborate in online discussions, or carry out research at home, while actively engaging concepts in the classroom, with a mentor's guidance.
In traditional classroom instruction, the teacher is typically the leader of a lesson, the focus of attention, and the primary disseminator of information during the class period. The teacher responds to questions while students defer directly to the teacher for guidance and feedback. Many traditional instructional models rely on lecture-style presentations of individual lessons, limiting student engagement to activities in which they work independently or in small groups on application tasks, devised by the teacher. The teacher typically takes a central role in class discussions, controlling the conversation's flow. Typically, this style of teaching also involves giving students the at-home tasks of reading from textbooks or practicing concepts by working, for example, on problem sets.The flipped classroom intentionally shifts instruction to a learner-centered model, in which students are often initially introduced to new topics outside of school, freeing up classroom time for the exploration of topics in greater depth, creating meaningful learning opportunities. With a flipped classroom, 'content delivery' may take a variety of forms, often featuring video lessons prepared by the teacher or third parties, although online collaborative discussions, digital research, and text readings may alternatively be used. The ideal length for a video lesson is widely cited as eight to 12 minutes.Flipped classrooms also redefine in-class activities. In-class lessons accompanying flipped classroom may include activity learning or more traditional homework problems, among other practices, to engage students in the content. Class activities vary but may include: using math manipulatives and emerging mathematical technologies, in-depth laboratory experiments, original document analysis, debate or speech presentation, current event discussions, peer reviewing, project-based learning, and skill development or concept practice Because these types of active learning allow for highly differentiated instruction, more time can be spent in class on higher-order thinking skills such as problem-finding, collaboration, design and problem solving as students tackle difficult problems, work in groups, research, and construct knowledge with the help of their teacher and peers.A teacher's interaction with students in a flipped classroom can be more personalized and less didactic, and students are actively involved in knowledge acquisition and construction as they participate in and evaluate their learning.},

	abstract = {The name of Militsa Vasilievna Nechkina in this public surfaced usually in connection with the condemnation of the “historical school”. Mikhail Nikolaevich Pokrovsky. One of his most famous students, standing up to her teacher when the party schooner made another sharp turn. She participated in the preparation of the “Short Course in the History of the {CPSU} (b)” – this parable in paganism for those who charitably, and became a kind of embodiment of the historian of Soviet times.{\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater}However, now that the creative and scientific path of M.V. Nechkina has already been studied far and wide, her diaries and memoirs of contemporaries and students have been published, researchers are increasingly saying that the “most Soviet historian” of his time was just another scientist who obeyed the authorities. Inspired, doubtful, accepting defeats and upholding their principles. After all, Nechkina’s career, like any other historian of those years, had its ups, downs and dangerous mistakes. So why not tell us more about them.{\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater}Militsa Vasilievna began her scientific career at Kazan University, graduating in 1921 from the historical department of the Faculty of History and Philology. Lectures, participation in scientific conferences and congresses, writing the first articles forged Nechkin as a scientist and professional. In 1924, she moved to Moscow, married David Arkadievich Epstein and continued her education, combining it with pedagogical activity.{\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater}Time flies and we move forward a few years. The stormy 1930s. Nechkina became a researcher first at the Institute of History of the Communist Academy, and then at the Institute of History of the Academy of Sciences. Since 1934, she began to teach at the revived history faculty of Moscow University. And about the same years - in 1935-1936 - he received the title of professor and the degree of doctor of historical sciences for his thesis "A.S. Griboyedov and Decembrists".{\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater}It was in Moscow that M.V. Nechkin “meet” the beginning of the “Academic case”, following which many academic historians, archivists and not only were arrested on charges of creating a “counter-revolutionary organization”. Despite the fact that Nechkina herself did not belong to the “old specialists”, being rather a model of a “red professor”, the danger of repression did not disappear. And with the beginning of the Soviet press campaign against the late teacher Militsa Vasilievna - M.N. Pokrovsky - it was not up to laughter. At least two-thirds of the 200 graduates of the Institute of Red Professors were repressed. The rest had no choice but to adapt, renounce their “infidel” beliefs and continue scientific work on new terms.{\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater}M.V. Nechkina herself escaped persecution by publishing two critical articles, where she analyzed the scientific and ideological miscalculations not only of her teacher, but also her own: “The Peasant Uprisings of Razin and Pugachev in the Concept of M.N. Pokrovsky” and “The Uprising of the Decembrists in the Concept of M.N. Pokrovsky”. In the diary of Nechkina, which is indicative, there is not a word about this campaign.{\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater}However, one way or another, the repression affected her family. In 1937, close relatives of both Militsa Vasilyevna and her husband were arrested. The elder brother of the scientist - Boris Vasilyevich - was shot in the same year, the husband of the middle sister of the Nechkin family - Ksenia - Peter Brodovsky - too. In 1938, her husband's brothers, Yakov and Ilya, and the wife of Yakov Arkadyevich, E.K. Sokolovskaya, were shot.{\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater}Nechkina herself, assessing those times, in her diary entry for 1933 will write:{\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textgreater} "In the ideological sense there was an arch ' decently ' - all toasts were front-page or 'Truths ' or 'News '".{\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater}And in the diary of another Soviet scientist - A. M. Pankratova - an entry for 1939 was preserved, where she asked Militsa Vasilyevna whether a person would get into the enemies of the people for a long time:{\textless}br{\textgreater} {\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textgreater} “To my question, then she does not believe that all convicted enemies of the people? No one believes it, she said.{\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater}Despite the fact that M.V. Nechkina, after successfully reflecting the threat of scientific ostracism and repression, became a well-respected historian, even her work was characterized by errors that could turn into unpleasant consequences. In 1940, she wrote an article “Why Russia Later Other Countries Entered the Path of Capitalist Development” for publication in the magazine “Bolshevik”. And in February 1941 she made a report at a meeting of the sector of history of the {USSR} of the {XIX}-{XX} centuries. As a result of the discussions, Nechkina’s theses and report received a sharp critical assessment, and she herself was accused of using non-Marxist, eclectic provisions, and committing a number of gross political mistakes. Despite the fact that in her report Nechkina followed the provisions expressed personally by I.V. Stalin, enshrined in the “Short Course in the History of the {CPSU}(b)”, the ideological line of the party had changed again by that time. And to recall the backwardness of Russia was inappropriate.{\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater}In October 1941, Militsa Vasilievna was evacuated to Tashkent, from where two years later she went to Iran as a lecturer. In 1943, she eventually returned to Moscow, continuing her scientific work. Four years later, she was elected a full member of the Academy of Pedagogical Sciences of the {USSR}. However, before her election as a full member of the Academy of Sciences of the {USSR}, a scientist who had already tried her luck in this field will have to wait another 11 years. - already until 1958. - In May 1943, while still in Tashkent, Nechkina wrote to her colleague I. I. Mints:{\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textgreater} " On 6 May, we held a meeting of the Academic Council of the Institute of History, where candidates were nominated for the upcoming elections for corresponding members of the Academy of Sciences and for academicians. My candidacy was put forward by our party organization... He described the Greeks. It is already clear to you, of course, that academics have failed me... I don't know if there's any way to fix it... I have to admit that I’m very sad..."{\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater}Another unpleasant episode in the life of M.V. Nechkina is associated with her accusation of Trotskyism in 1961 Despite the fact that by that time Nechkina was already a recognized Soviet historian and academician, a certain professor D.I. Kovalevsky filed an official statement about the existence of anti-Leninist errors in her writings of the 1920s. A colleague accused Nechkina of propagating Trotskyism in her early works and took the discussion of this question to the official level. She did not wait for the weather by the sea and wrote an equally official protest. To resolve this conflict, a commission was created under the chairmanship of B.A. Rybakov, who... sided with Kovalevsky. A few months later, on May 21, 1961, the latter made his accusations at the Moscow State University in front of the general public. Nechkina went further and wrote a letter to the President of the Academy of Sciences of the {USSR} - academician A.N. Nesmeyanov, in which she asked to investigate the case in more detail. In addition, M.V. Nechkina sent a letter to the Central Committee, in which she outlined the whole situation and pointed out that what was happening was connected with intra-university squabbles. Like, earlier she accused Professor A.A. Fedorov of plagiarism, whose defender was Kovalevsky:{\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textgreater} “A wild, incredibly stupid story with a political denunciation of me by a friend of A. Fedorov D. I. Kovalevsky ... All this would not be worth a penny if it were not for the stupidest, stupidest ' resolution ' B.A. Rybakov, adopted in absentia, in my absence !"{\textless}br{\textgreater} {\textless}br{\textgreater}In April of the same year, a meeting of the Bureau of the Department of Historical Sciences of the Academy of Sciences of the {USSR} was held, at which the commission’s decision, although not canceled, was recognized by some of Kovalchenko’s accusations and methods of his “work” as unworthy and unreasonable. Such a decision also did not suit Nechkin, and therefore she sent a protest to the Presidium of the Academy of Sciences of the {USSR} under the heading “Why it is impossible to agree with the resolution of acad. Rybakov”, in which she considered in detail the essence of the slander. The fact was that in his article of 1960 “On the periodization of the history of Soviet historical science”. Nechkina also mentioned her early article “The Science of Russian History” when she considered the historiography of the issue. Kovalevsky, in turn, fabricated quotes from Nechkina’s articles and “found” in them the propaganda of Trotskyism. Ultimately, this epic ended by July 1961 After the next meeting of the Presidium of the Academy of Sciences of the {USSR} M.V. Nechkina wrote in her diary:{\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textgreater} “Resolved: to grant my request - the decision of the commission of B.A. Rybakov to cancel and notify the Central Committee of the {CPSU} ... He lost to B.A. Fisher. Justice has triumphed (over half a year of struggle !)".{\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater}Since that time, no scandals no longer concerned the years-wise Militsa Vasilievna. In 1960-1985, she was the editor-in-chief of Essays on the History of Historical Science in the {USSR}, the first generalizing work on domestic historiography. She also owns the idea of creating a historiographic yearbook “History and historians”. In the early 1970s, she became the editor-in-chief of this publication, often defending problematic articles. Many biographers Nechkina claim that in their post-Stalinist views, Militsa Vasilievna took the side of the “sixties”, opposing censorship and unfounded devastating reviews. However, looking at the development of Soviet historical science, it is worth saying that it is not worth exaggerating the historiographic achievements of those years.{\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater}Who in the end for now sees Militsa Vasilievna Nechkina? Actual researcher of the Decembrists and the work of A.S. Griboyedov? A philosopher of history and historiographer who made a contribution to the development of Soviet science? Or another historian, moving in accordance with the party line, acting according to circumstances in an attempt to preserve his position? Well, let's go. To reproach the Soviet historian that he, unwilling to put his life and scientific work in danger, obeys power and party attitudes, is now quite difficult. The historiographical achievements of M.V. Nechkina are now somewhat doubtful, but as a profile specialist in Decembrists, she will somehow appear in the list of literature of a novice historian. And even in the case of the criticism of M.N. Pokrovsky, which, it would seem, identified Nechkin as a historian of the “new type”, everything is not so simple. Many biographers M.V. Nechkina see even in her “crushing articles” a certain rod that did not allow the scientist to leave the late teacher without praise. However, how Militsa Vasilyevna loved, criticized and rehabilitated her teacher, we will talk next time.{\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater}1. Vandalkovskaya M. G.

November 5] 1896 – June 11, 1934) was a Soviet psychologist, known for his work on psychological development in children. He published on a diverse range of subjects, and from multiple views as his perspective changed over the years. Among his students was Alexander Luria and Kharkiv school of psychology.
He is known for his concept of the zone of proximal development ({ZPD}): the distance between what a student (apprentice, new employee, etc.) can do on their own, and what they can accomplish with the support of someone more knowledgeable about the activity. Vygotsky saw the {ZPD} as a measure of skills that are in the process of maturing, as supplement to measures of development that only look at a learner's independent ability.
Also influential are his works on the relationship between language and thought, the development of language, and a general theory of development through actions and relationships in a socio-cultural environment. This can be found in many of his essays.
Vygotsky is the subject of great scholarly dispute. There is a group of scholars who see parts of Vygotsky's current legacy as distortions and who are going back to Vygotsky's manuscripts in an attempt to make Vygotsky's legacy more true to his actual ideas.},

It is the range where they are capable only with support from someone with more knowledge or expertise ("more knowledgeable other"),  the degree to which children can rapidly develop under social guidance, as compared to alone. The concept was introduced, but not fully developed, by psychologist Lev Vygotsky (1896–1934) during the last three years of his life. Vygotsky argued that a child gets involved in a dialogue with the "more knowledgeable other" such as a peer or an adult and gradually, through social interaction and sense-making, develops the ability to solve problems independently and do certain tasks without help. Following Vygotsky, some educators believe that the role of education is to give children experiences that are within their zones of proximal development, thereby encouraging and advancing their individual learning such as skills and strategies.},

The scoping review is underpinned by the five-stage framework Arksey and O'Malley. The results indicate that there is much indirect evidence emerging of improved academic performance and student and staff satisfaction with the flipped approach but a paucity of conclusive evidence that it contributes to building lifelong learning and other 21st Century skills in under-graduate education and post-graduate education.},

A controltreatment experiment comparing an inverted classroom to a traditional lecture-style format was used. The results show that: 1) the inverted classroom allowed the instructor to cover more material; 2) students participating in the inverted classroom performed as well or better on comparable quiz and exam questions and on openended design problems; and 3) while students initially struggled with the new format, they adapted quickly and found the inverted classroom format to be satisfactory and effective.},

Previous work has discussed the potential of flipped classrooms to leverage active learning through the use of videos and other computer-based tools that encourage students to explore course content autonomously. This study explores how the tools and tactics used in the course, namely out-of-class readings and Jupyter notebooks, can be effective to engage students and foster learning. To that aim, the final study will compare the changes in perceptions and performance of two classes (Fall 2019 and Spring 2020) before and after students take the course. The perceptions part of the instrument focuses on students’ self-efficacy and interest in programming. On the other hand, the performance part of the instrument asks students to explain the purpose of simple programs by examining the code. Preliminary results suggest that the flipped format implemented increases students' self-efficacy regarding programming tasks, particularly within students already interested in this computational modeling. These results align well with preliminary performance results, which suggest that the strategy implemented prompts more students to try solving the programming problems and provide explanations, yet not always complete or correct.},

The design of the Jupyter notebook is in many ways well suited for teaching subjects in information technology and computer science, but it is a tool that departs significantly from a standard text editor or integrated development environment, and thus carries with it several unique advantages as well as several surprising potential pitfalls. As use of Jupyter notebooks has grown, so has criticism of the notebook, for varied reasons: notebooks can behave in unexpected ways, they can be difficult to reproduce, they open up potential security issues, and they may encourage poor coding practices. A set of best practices to guide instructors and help addressing these concerns when using Jupyter notebooks in the classroom is currently lacking. This paper addresses the strengths and weaknesses of the Jupyter notebook for education, drawing on existing literature as well as the author’s experience teaching a range of courses with Jupyter notebooks for over five years, and recommends a set of best practices for teaching with the Jupyter notebook.},

	abstract = {\# Introduction
In 2018, the Ecole polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne ({EPFL}, Switzerland), embarked on a major curriculum reform to introduce computational thinking across its science and engineering programs.
Thanks to their multi-representational nature combining interactive code ("computational") and rich text ("thinking"), Jupyter notebooks have been identified as a key enabling technology for this project.
The Center for Digital Education of {EPFL} has therefore created, in September 2019, a centralized service to support teachers in the development and use of Jupyter notebooks for their classes and Massive Open Online Courses ({MOOCs}).
This service consists of a technical infrastructure in the form of a centralized {JupyterLab} platform, a technical support component and pedagogical support component.
In this talk, we will present how we have developed this service and share our experience both in terms of challenges encountered and solutions implemented.
We hope to provide useful insights to teachers and institutions interested in deploying Jupyter notebooks for education at scale.

\# Centralized {JupyterLab} platform
The centralized {JupyterLab} platform has proved to play a pivotal role in the transformation of our teachers’ practices.
By making it easy for anyone to use and produce notebooks directly in their browser without any installation, it has simplified drastically the class logistics and has attracted more and more users over the years.
Since 2019, more than 9600 unique users have used our centralized {JupyterLab} platform, and 3500 users are active all year round. 
During the autumn semester 2022-2023, we have had an average of 350 daily users on the platform.
Dealing with user surges at the beginning of classes and with increasing numbers of concurrent users, and managing shared resources while allowing non-trivial types of use (e.g. machine learning) are typical examples of challenges we have faced.

\# Technical support
Beyond answering requests from teachers, an important role of our technical support has been to adapt the service to the pedagogical needs associated with teaching computational thinking in a science and engineering context.

Because the practice of computational thinking takes various forms in various fields, our technical support has evaluated and installed a range of different types of software stacks and libraries.
For instance, we have installed specific kernels for simulations in computational chemistry or for polyglot notebooks in image processing ([the Script of Script kernel](https://vatlab.github.io/sos-docs)). Our [computational neuroscience {MOOCs}](https://www.epfl.ch/research/domains/bluebrain/blue-brain/massive-open-online-courses/) use a separate instance of {JupyterLab} with a specific software stack and a {LTI} front-end ([Learning Tools Interoperability](https://www.imsglobal.org/activity/learning-tools-interoperability)) to accommodate users that are external to our institution.

Using notebooks for educational purposes also involves operations that are specific to education such as managing assignments. 
Most institutions use learning management systems such as [moodle](https://moodle.org) for these tasks, but these don’t necessarily interface with {JupyterLab} beyond file upload/download. We have developed a [moodle plugin](https://github.com/epfl-cede/moodle-jupyterhub-plugin) that interfaces with a {JupyterHub} installation, making the whole notebook assignment workflow easier from the assignment creation to the transmission of notebook-based feedback to students.

\# Pedagogical support
Because the range of possible pedagogical patterns for Jupyter notebooks is wide (see [“Teaching and Learning with Jupyter”](https://jupyter4edu.github.io/jupyter-edu-book/)), a first challenge for us has been to help teachers choose ways to use notebooks that are likely to help students develop the targeted knowledge and skills.
Using results from research in different domains of learning sciences, we have experimented and developed best practices for teachers to optimize the design of their notebooks in five scenarios: virtual demonstrations, interactive textbooks, exercise worksheets, labs and projects, and graded assignments.
This work has resulted in the development of several training workshops for teachers as well as a complete website including teacher interviews: [https://go.epfl.ch/notebooks](https://go.epfl.ch/notebooks).
Of course, developing notebooks for a course requires a significant investment in time and resources for teachers. We accompany them with both funding and advice for developing their projects.
Finally, to foster networking and exchanges, we invite teachers to share how they use notebooks in their classes or {MOOCs} in bi-annual community events.
We will present examples of notebooks from the [27 git repositories](https://go.epfl.ch/notebookexamples) we have documented so far.},
